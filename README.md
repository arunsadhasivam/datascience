Linear regression:
==================
Linear equations all look like this y= mx + b.
M is your rate of change. Ask yourself, when that x thing goes up by 1, how much does y go up (or down)? This will be your m.
B is your constant. This is the initial value of y. The value of y when x is 0.
Finally, y is the thing that depends on x.
Oh right, examples:
1.) I buy a printer for $100 and the ink cartridges cost $25 each. What is the relationship between ink cartridges and total cost?
total cost = 25(cartridges I buy) + 100 or y = 25x + 100

2.) I get a $100 iTunes gift card for my birthday and then start buying $1 songs. What is the relationship between number of songs I buy and how much is left on the card?
amount left on card = -$1(songs bought) + 100 or y = -x +100

3.) I spend $100 in one-time costs to open a lemonade stand. Every glass I of lemonade I make costs $.05 and I sell them for $.25. Assuming I sell all the lemonade I make, what is the relationship between number of glasses of lemonade I sell and the profit I make?
profit = $.25(glasses I sell) - .05(glasses I sell) - 100
or y = .25x - .05x - 100 = .20x - 100
There's about a million examples of linear equations in "the real world." There's a bunch of algebra that the average Joe will never use, but this stuff shows up everywhere.
